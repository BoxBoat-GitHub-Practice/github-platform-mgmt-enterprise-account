# Quickstart

## Overview
This project is currently in POC state, and requires users to run terraform/tooling locally on their terminal.
 
### Prerequisites
1. Create a GitHub organization if you don't already have one.
2. Create a GitHub repository to hold the IaC for your organization. 
3. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token(PAT) that has the appropriate scope to manage organization resources.
 
### Inputs
1. set the GITHUB_TOKEN=<_PAT> and GITHUB_OWNER=<org_name> environment variables within your terminal session
2. remove & include any root level .tf files(people.tf, repositories.tf, settings.tf, teams.tf) for your desired configuration. For example, if you only want to manage an org's settings only include the settings.tf configuration file within the root directory.
3. rename & adjust the template.tfvars file as necessary
4. run:
   - `terraform init`
   - `terraform plan -var-file=template.tfvars`
   - `terraform apply -var-file=template.tfvars`
 
### Outputs
TBD
